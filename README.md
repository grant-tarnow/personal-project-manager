# Personal Project Manager

Personal Project Manager (PPM) is just that, a tool to manage one person's projects. Everything is stored in a single sqlite3 database. At the moment, you interact with this database using a clunky perl script.

A local-hosted website GUI is in-progress.

NOTE: This project is very much still in-progress.
